Generate a comprehensive table for the automobile industry. The table should have two columns:
1. Industry Segments: List various segments or sub-categories within the given industry.
2. Materials Used: For each segment, provide a list of key materials commonly used in that specific segment.
Please format the table as follows:
| Industry Segment | Materials Used |
|------------------|----------------|
| [Segment 1]      | [Material 1, Material 2, Material 3, ...] |
| [Segment 2]      | [Material 1, Material 2, Material 3, ...] |
| ...              | ... |
Ensure that:
1. The segments are diverse and cover the main areas of the industry.
2. The materials listed are specific to each segment and commonly used in that part of the industry.
3. You provide as many segments as possible and as many  materials  as possible for each segment.
4. No additional text should be generated, only csv file should be generated
5. Materials should not be raw materials but systems like various types of brake systems.
Example input: Automobile Industry
Expected output format:
| Industry Segment   | Materials Used |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Passenger Vehicles | [Materials list] |
| Commercial Vehicles| [Materials list] |
| Two-wheelers       | [Materials list] |
| Three-wheelers     | [Materials list] |
| Tractors           | [Materials list] |
